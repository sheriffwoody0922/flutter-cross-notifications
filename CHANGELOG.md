# [0.5.1+2]
* Highlight note on migrating to AndroidX more in README

# [0.5.1+1]
* README corrections and add information on migrating to AndroidX

# [0.5.1]
* Updated gradle plugin of example app to 3.3.1
* Added support for messaging style notifications on Android as requested in issue [159](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/159). See example app for some sample code

# [0.5.0]
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Migrated to use AndroidX as the Android support libraries are deprecated. There shouldn't be any functional changes. Developers may require migrating their apps to support this following [this guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate). This addresses issue [162]. (https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/162). Thanks to Jeff Scaturro (JeffScaturro) for submitting the PR for this work. Note that if you don't want to migrate your app to use AndroidX yet then you may need to pin dependencies to a specific version

# [0.4.5]
* Fix issue [160](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/160) so that notifications created with the `schedule` on Android will appear at the exact date and time they are scheduled

# [0.4.4+2]
* Fix CHANGELOG

# [0.4.4+1]
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Fix naming of `onDidReceiveLocalNotification` property in the `IOSInitializationSettings` class (was previously named `onDidReceiveLocalNotificationCallback` by accident)

# [0.4.4]
*  **BREAKING CHANGE** removed `registerUNNotificationCenterDelegate` argument for the `IOSInitializationSettings` class as it wasn't actually used.
* Plugin can now handle `didReceiveLocalNotification` delegate method in iOS and allow developers to handle the associated callback in Flutter. Added a `onDidReceiveLocalNotificationCallback` argument to the `IOSInitializationSettings` class to enable this and updated the sample code to demonstrate the usage. This should resolve issue [14](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/14).

# [0.4.3]
* Merged PR from Aine LLC (ganessaa) to fix issue [140] (https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/140) where scheduled notifications were shown immediately on iOS versions before 10. Note that this issue is likely related to an [known issue in the Flutter engine](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21313) that may require switching channels to be addressed as the fix isn't on the stable channel yet.
* [Android] Provide a way to hide the large icon when showing an expanded big picture notification via the  `hideExpandedLargeIcon` flag within thr `BigPictureStyleInformation` class. This provides a solution for issue [136](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/136). Updated the example to demonstrate
* Merged PR from (riccardoratta) so that sample code is coloured in GitHub to improve readability.

# [0.4.2+1]
* Update changelog to indicate when `MessageHandler` typedef got renamed (in 0.4.1) as raised in issue [132](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/132)

# [0.4.2]
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Fix issue [127](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/127) by changing plugin to Android Support Library version 27.1.1, compile and target SDK version to 27 due to issues Flutter has with API 28. 

# [0.4.1+1]
* Remove unused code in example app

# [0.4.1]
* **BREAKING CHANGE** renamed the `selectNotification` callback exposed by the `initialize` function to `onSelectNotification`
* **BREAKING CHANGE** renamed the `MessageHandler` typedef to `SelectNotificationCallback`
* **BREAKING CHANGE** updated plugin to Android Support Library version 28.0, compile and target SDK version to 28
* Address issue [115](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/115) by adding validation to the notification ID values. This ensure they're within the range of a 32-bit integer as notification IDs on Android need to be within that range. Note that an `ArgumentError` is thrown when a value is out of range. 
* Updated the Android Integration section around registering receivers via the Android manifest as per the suggestion in [116](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/116)
* Updated version of the http dependency for used by the example app

# [0.4.0]
* [Android] Fix issue [112](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/112) where big picture notifications wouldn't show

# [0.3.9]
* [Android] Added ability to show progress notifications and updated example app to demonstrate how to display them

# [0.3.8]
* Added `getNotificationAppLaunchDetails()` method that could be used to determine if the app was launched via notification (raised in issue [99](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/99))
* Added documentation around ProGuard configuration to Android Integration section of the README

## [0.3.7]
* [Android] Fix issue [88](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/88) where cancelled notifications could reappear on reboot.

## [0.3.6]
* [Android] Add mapping to the setOnlyAlertOnce method [83](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/83). Allows the sound, vibrate and ticker to be played if the notification is not already showing
* [Android] Add mapping to setShowBadge for notification channels that controls if notifications posted to channel can appear as application icon badges in a Launcher

## [0.3.5]
* [Android] Will now throw a PlatformException with a more friendly error message on the Flutter side when a specified resource hasn't been found e.g. when specifying the icon for the notification
* Fix overflow rendering issue in the example app

## [0.3.4]
* [Android] Fix issue [71](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/71) where the wrong time on when the notification occurred is being displayed. **BREAKING CHANGE** this involves changing it the receiver for displaying a scheduled notification will only build the notification prior to displaying it. There is a fix applied to existing scheduled notifications in this release that will be eventually be removed as going forward all scheduled notifications will work as just described
* [Android] Fix an issue with serialising and deserialising the notifications so that additional style types (big picture and inbox) would be recognised. This affected scheduled notifications where upon rebooting the device, the plugin would need to reschedule the notifications using information saved in shared preferences.

## [0.3.3]
* [iOS] Fixes issue [61](https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications/issues/61) where the `showDailyAtTime` and `showWeeklyAtDayAndTime` methods may not show notifications that should appear the next day. Thanks to Jeff Scaturro (JeffScaturro) for submitting the PR to fix this.

* Updated README information the example app and configuring Android notification icons
* Changelog is now in reverse chronological order so details about the most recent release are at the top
* Additional comments in the example's main.dart file to refer to downloading the complete example app project from GitHub

## [0.3.0]

* **BREAKING CHANGES** restructured code so that only a single import statement is now needed to use the plugin. Classes that had the platform (Android/iOS) as a suffix are now prefixes to improve readability of code and follow the recommendations for writing Dart code i.e. write code that reads more like a sentence. The following have been renamed

    * InitializationSettingsAndroid -> AndroidInitializationSettings
    * InitializationSettingsIOS -> IOSInitializationSettings
    * NotificationDetailsAndroid -> AndroidNotificationDetails
    * NotificationStyleAndroid -> AndroidNotificationStyle
    * NotificationDetailsIOS -> IOSNotificationDetails

* [Android] Add ability to show grouped notifications. Example code has been updated to demonstrate this functionality.
* Fixed the example project so it works with the new release of Cocoapods (1.5.0)
* Fixes for when API methods were called without specifying platform specific settings

## [0.1.6]

* **BREAKING CHANGES** Apologies again, this is another cleanup release. FlutterLocalNotifications class has been renamed to FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin now as it makes more sense from a readability perspective. More importantly, the class and methods are also no longer static to faciliate mocking and testing. It's something I should've picked up on earlier so sorry once again. Check the source code for an example on how to mock the plugin when testing

## [0.1.5]

* **BREAKING CHANGES** There are no functional changes. This is an API cleanup release where I've reorganised the Dart classes to better separate them by platform. What this means is that the import statements in your coode will need to be fixed. Apologies to anyone using the plugin but I feel that this was necessary as Flutter may target additional platforms in the future. Hopefully you'll agree that the end result looks a better :)

## [0.1.4]

* [Android] Add inbox notification style

## [0.1.3]

* Fix broken example app for iOS due to incorrect reference to custom sound file. Added ability to handle when a notification is tapped. See updated example for details on how to do this and will navigate to another page. Note that the second page isn't rendering full-screen on Android if the notification was tapped on while the app was in the foreground. Suspect that this is Flutter rendering issue and have logged this on the Flutter repository at https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16636
